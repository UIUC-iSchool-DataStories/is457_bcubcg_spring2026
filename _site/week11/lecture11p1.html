# Tips to Declutter Slides

notes:
so, during your MP1's and in your feedback you'll notice that we definitely emphasized that slides/viz needs to be clear to your audience.

some folks have already started using arrows/boxes to display these things, but we wanted to give some more examples of these from some "real life" talks

---

## Break down cluttered slides

* Avoid big text blocks
* Break text across multiple slides
* If you need to duplicate a graph/chart, consider annotating the second appearance to direct the audience's attention

notes:
so here are some general "rules of thumb" that Prof. Kate McDowell (who will be working with you all in a few weeks) has used to sort of outline some ways to declutter slides

---

## "Easy" annotations for graphics (not made by you)

notes:
so, the first is some tips for graphs that you might want to include that are not created by you

notes:

now there are definitely some other things we'd probably want to change -- for example, we might even consider putting our own text over these labels as they are a little pixelated 

(and we'd probably want to change the colors, and add a y-axis, and make axis labels bigger, etc)

BUT!  This is still MUCH improved from what it was before

notes:
next, we can do things like add visual ques for our audience as we walk them through the graph

after starting by walking our audience through the axis labels and overall meaning of our graph, maybe we want to highlight some aspects of our graph

for example, let's say I want folks to focus on where Russia is in this graph, I can add an arrow

* Break down dense slides with visual cues

notes:
to this list from Prof. McDowell, I'd add one more thing -- sometimes you need to have dense slides for whatever reason, but you want to make sure you break these down as much as possible

here is a quick example from one of my talks

<br>
<br>
<br>

# Version \#1

notes:
So, first I'll show you a version of a slide in one of my talks.

The context for this slide is that I'm introducing a corpus of historical texts that we want to "digitize" (i.e. make machine-readable.)

---

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/example_breakdown_slides/short_tpdl_example_is457.001.png" data-background-size="auto 95%" data-background-position="right 50% bottom 50%" -->

notes:
Our corpus of interest is the historical astrophysics literature with the initial dataset containing ~50k scanned pages, but with the potential total corpus encompassing about 3 Million articles of 5-10 pages each.

This data covers the years from about 1850-1997, i.e. the “pre-digital” era in in which text and other page objects is not easily extracted from the PDF

We want to “digitize” these documents. And by “digitizing” here we mean extracting specific page objects including things like tables, math formulas, figures and figure
captions.

<br>
<br>
<br>

# Version \#2

---

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/example_breakdown_slides/short_tpdl_example_is457.003.png" data-background-size="auto 95%" data-background-position="right 50% bottom 50%" alt="link to PDF version of slides here:" -->

## Break down cluttered slides

* Avoid big text blocks
* Break text across multiple slides
* If you need to duplicate a graph/chart, consider annotating the second appearance to direct the audience's attention

notes:
in my case, the bolding defaults in Markdown aren't super strong (in my opinion) so I might break these down bullet point by bullet point...

notes:
no matter which way you chose, note that this will be increasing your slide and talk development time significantly, so be sure to plan for that when organizing your time for your final data stories preparation

## Break down cluttered slides

* Avoid big text blocks
* Break text across multiple slides
* If you need to duplicate a graph/chart, consider annotating the second appearance to direct the audience's attention
* Break down dense slides with visual cues

notes:
to this list from Prof. McDowell, I'd add one more thing -- sometimes you need to have dense slides for whatever reason, but you want to make sure you break these down as much as possible

here is a quick example from one of my talks

# Version \#1

notes:
So, first I'll show you a version of a slide in one of my talks.

The context for this slide is that I'm introducing a corpus of historical texts that we want to "digitize" (i.e. make machine-readable.)

---

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/example_breakdown_slides/short_tpdl_example_is457.001.png" data-background-size="auto 95%" data-background-position="right 50% bottom 50%" -->

notes:
Our corpus of interest is the historical astrophysics literature with the initial dataset containing ~50k scanned pages, but with the potential total corpus encompassing about 3 Million articles of 5-10 pages each.

This data covers the years from about 1850-1997, i.e. the “pre-digital” era in in which text and other page objects is not easily extracted from the PDF

We want to “digitize” these documents. And by “digitizing” here we mean extracting specific page objects including things like tables, math formulas, figures and figure
captions.
